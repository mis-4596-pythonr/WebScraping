Webscrapping

This code analyzes how to pull and clean the data off of a website.  The website is 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_past_and_future_population' and we were pulling the data from the table on the page.  The true comparison between the two were the library's diction and how they handled the data.
